This project explores the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Text-to-Image models to automate the complete generation of a simple website. It encompasses everything from developing the structure to creating the content. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs for generating coherent and contextually relevant text, and Text-to-Image models for creating visual content, the project aims to streamline the web development process. The goal is to demonstrate how these advanced AI technologies can be integrated to produce a fully functional and aesthetically pleasing website with minimal human intervention. Key aspects include automating layout design, generating text content, creating custom images, and ensuring seamless integration of all components.
